					This was a fun project to do! At the end of ARS 324 (Graphic Design), we had to make a video
					that communicated our personalities (a description deliberately left vague). I wanted to convey 
					my experiences with both programming and making digital media. More importantly, I wanted to show 
					how I could use both skill sets for the same project.
					</p>
					<p class="body">
					<b>Fun Fact:</b> 
						The talking sprite featured at the end of the video had two forms - mouth open and mouth closed.
						These toggled with every keystroke. If I pressed keys an odd number of times, the program would leave 
						the sprite's mouth hanging open (and his face looking kind of stupid).

					The original recording of this video was around five hours long. Speeding it up shortened it 
					to just five minutes, but presented its own problems - zooming in and out is disorienting at this speed. 
					The proportions also don't look quite right, as the head seems too wide compared to the shoulders and hips. 
					Were I to do this again, I would pay more attention to both problems - assuming, of course, 
					I could be pulled away from the convenience of Adobe Illustrator.
