				CCS 395 was an odd class in that it was dedicated to wikis - general-purpose collections of information like
				<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> or smaller sites for specific topics. 
				The curriculum went the processes by which they collect and spread information, and how just having that information 
				does not grant knowledge and understanding.<br>
				Looking back at my final project for the class, I can definitely say that this is true. I made this wiki as a guide 
				for the EBoard members that would take over the Running Club. While some of the information here might have been 
				useful as a reference, no wiki alone was going to fully prepare them for club leadership. Only getting stuck in 
				responsibilities and deadlines was going to do that. Thankfully for everyone involved, they've done a fine job thus far.

				The Computer Science major at Stony Brook requires all students to take CSE 300 - Technical Communications. 
				I really liked this class, because it was a refreshing break from theory and programming. Instead, it focused 
				on "soft skills" like building a resum&eacute;, writing a cover letter, and presenting an idea.<br>
				Admittedly, I should have fleshed out the idea I was presenting more. I knew I wanted to make a video game
				that used Stony Brook as a setting, but I didn't know much else. Thankfully, this pitch was less about 
				making an actual game than it was about convincing other people that it was possible. Coincidentally, I decided 
				to make a game for my senior project not too long afterwards.

				When she first explained this assignment, my CSE 300 professor said that the manual should be around 3 - 4 pages.
				When she said that I could add pictures, I, uh, went a little overboard.<br>
				In all seriousness, I really enjoyed making this. I've spent a fair amount of time using the Stony Brook computer labs, 
				and the combination of scanners and the Adobe Creative Cloud is incredibly useful. Admittedly, there probably aren't many 
				people who would find this useful - it assumes that the reader is a Stony Brook student, and that they're editing digital images.
				Nevertheless, it was a fun project to think and write about.

					Honors College classes at Stony Brook are good at making you think about subjects that you wouldn't ordinarily.
					HON 301 was no exception, and I spent a lot more time thinking about sex education than I ever thought I would.
					It's a contentious subject, and for very good reason - it's very hard to view sex ed with an objective lens.
					Almost every detail - who should be teaching, what material they should cover, what behaviors they should encourage - 
					elicits a strong emotional response. This matters, because cultural perspectives often carry more weight than facts 
					when building support for public policy.<br>
					I knew almost immediately that I wanted to present on this topic, but I didn't (and still don't) fully understand why.
					I also didn't make a huge impact - only 20 people ever saw my presentation and paper. That said, I do still think that 
					this topic was worth discussing, and I would glady do so again.

				I wrote this paper in my freshman year of college, when I was still adjusting to life on campus. 
				I still had trouble understanding and sorting out my feelings about high school, and about what I thought 
				I'd accomplished. Writing about my high school track team was very personal, because the experience 
				summed up how I felt about my life thus far - it was exhausting and difficult, and I'd enjoyed it, but I 
				didn't have many tangible achievements to show for it.<br>
				Looking at the paper now usually makes me cringe, and not just because of the writing style. 
				It gives voice to a time when I was insecure and afraid, not really knowing what steps to take next.
				It's still my voice, and I wouldn't trade my years in high school or college for anything in the world.
				But that doesn't mean that every moment was the best time of my life.
