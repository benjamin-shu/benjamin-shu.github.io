				CCS 395 was an odd class in that it was dedicated to wikis - general-purpose collections of information like
				<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> or smaller sites for specific topics. 
				The curriculum went the processes by which they collect and spread information, and how just having that information 
				does not grant knowledge and understanding.<br>
				Looking back at my final project for the class, I can definitely say that this is true. I made this wiki as a guide 
				for the EBoard members that would take over the Running Club. While some of the information here might have been 
				useful as a reference, no wiki alone was going to fully prepare them for club leadership. Only getting stuck in 
				responsibilities and deadlines was going to do that. Thankfully for everyone involved, they've done a fine job thus far.

				The Computer Science major at Stony Brook requires all students to take CSE 300 - Technical Communications. 
				I really liked this class, because it was a refreshing break from theory and programming. Instead, it focused 
				on "soft skills" like building a resum&eacute;, writing a cover letter, and presenting an idea.<br>
				Admittedly, I should have fleshed out the idea I was presenting more. I knew I wanted to make a video game
				that used Stony Brook as a setting, but I didn't know much else. Thankfully, this pitch was less about 
				making an actual game than it was about convincing other people that it was possible. Coincidentally, I decided 
				to make a game for my senior project not too long afterwards.
